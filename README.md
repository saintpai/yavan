Yet Another Vmcore ANalyzer (YAVAN)

YAVAN is an attempt to automate the analysis of vmcores.

The word "yavan" means "Greek" in Sanskrit - as in "analyzing vmcores
is Greek to me" :-)

Analyzing vmcores is difficult. It requires deep knowledge of the
kernel. In addition, kernel engineers employ a variety of hueristics in
their debugging. Yavan will try to enshrine as many such hueristics in
code, as I can
